After 3 months of waiting, installing, <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewtodd/statuses/242369552">flooding</a>, more waiting, <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewtodd/statuses/330288642">shipping</a>, fixing, and re-installing, we <strong>washed our first load of laundry</strong> Saturday!

Oh, man, it was beautiful.

Previously, Sylvia, the lady who works in our house, had been amazingly hand-washing all of our clothes in the <a href="/2007/04/17/this-is-why-blogs-were-invented/">sometime bug-ridden basin</a> out back. This will ease a bit of her work, and also keep some of our <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/blixytees.10116504" title="chunky. bacon.">favorite</a> <a href="http://www.futurefreak.co.uk/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&manufacturers_id=19&products_id=121&zenid=036519daae087babb6f5253b4bf7334d" title="picocontainer">t-shirts</a> from getting so stretched out.

Now for the final hurdle: learning to use the blooming thing. You'd think it would be easy, but somehow it ends up reminding me of <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/dry3.html">the helicopter story</a>. So to help, we've taped a photocopy of the instructions up on the wall above the machine:

Yikes.
