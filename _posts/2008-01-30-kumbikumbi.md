At the first big rain of the season, we get swarmed with these huge flying termites. Swarmed! They hatch, live for a day, and die. So, the last few nights, our house was full of these mad zombie termites lurching about in the throes of death.

Lovely.

What better to do than to eat them?

No joke. Before I knew it, Sylvia had gathered them all up, cooked them in a pot in the garage, and brought me a plate, saying, "Here, try these, they're delicious!"

I did.

They weren't.
