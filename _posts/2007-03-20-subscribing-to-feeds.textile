If you'd like to give the <a href="/2007/03/15/reading/">Bible-reading feeds</a> a try but don't know where to start, here's a quick guide:

<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="http://reading.matthewtodd.org/plans/discipleship-journal">http://reading.matthewtodd.org/plans/discipleship-journal</a>.</li>
<li>Click "Google Reader" in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Click the big blue "Add to Google Reader" button.</li>
</ol>

Then, each day, visit <a href="http://reader.google.com/">http://reader.google.com</a> to catch up with the day's reading.

Incidentally, you can subscribe to this blog in the same way. If there are a handful of sites you follow, using such a feed-reading tool will allow you to check up on all of them in the same place.

<p class="update"><strong>NB:</strong> This guide assumes a Google account, but if you haven't one, Bloglines is a good choice: use the Bloglines link in the sidebar and follow your nose.</p>
