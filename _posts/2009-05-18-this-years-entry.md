<p>Valerie's Mom's coming for a visit next week, and so, <a href="{{ site.url }}/2007/09/28/perquackey.html">in keeping with tradition</a>, it's time for a little Perquackey smack talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <div>Yonder bridge doth arch and span</div>
    <div>Over river, treacherous land,</div>
    <div>Up from rocks on which are dashed</div>
    <div>Remains of jumpers,</div>
    <div>Life's check cashed.</div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>Oh, their lives they cut so short,</div>
    <div>Seeking damages, retorts,</div>
    <div>Ere they learned that winner's bray</div>
    <div>Rings naught but hollow; their decay</div>
    <div>Haphazards forth in</div>
    <div>Od'rous ruin,</div>
    <div>Odious runes ghast dark and grey.</div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>Decrypt ye there the message lying,</div>
    <div>Kindred spirits' fate decrying,</div>
    <div>Ne'er again sweet light of day</div>
    <div>Oversundring their dismay.</div>
    <div>Withhold your taunts, you French ka-nigget,</div>
    <div>Step down from tower high and bri'g it.</div>
    <div>Nine, nay, ten dice all that matter</div>
    <div>On this table, curs'd idle patter.</div>
    <div>Blessed be the man whose letters speak</div>
    <div>Out for themselves, and if they're weak,</div>
    <div>Unbridled fury does not seek.</div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <div>Nine days until the tourney fair, ten</div>
    <div>Dice plus three of color rare</div>
    <div>Suffice. And may the sweet light glare.</div>
  </p>
</blockquote>
