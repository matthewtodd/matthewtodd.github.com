If you read this site, you're probably already my mom. But, in the off chance you're somebody else, you may not know that

<ol>
<li>Valerie's brother Russell is very, <strong>very</strong> funny, and</li>
<li>He was picked to open for Lewis Black at the Carolina Comedy Festival a couple of months ago!</li>
</ol>

And thanks to his buddies, we can now all hear <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph1qNEoTpnI">this recording of his performance</a>, after which The Daily Tar Heel <a href="http://www.dailytarheel.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=48d49c66-2adb-4a7a-a2e0-a4ac48d0a950">called him</a> "an outstanding young talent with a delivery that was at once spastic, awkward and oddly endearing."

He's fantastic---<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph1qNEoTpnI">enjoy!</a>
