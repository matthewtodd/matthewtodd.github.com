To be a little safer, we boil all our drinking water and keep it in a bunch of reused 1.5 liter bottles by the sink. My presence here has at least doubled most of Valerie's resource consumption, and especially so with water: I've been drinking about a gallon of water a day, what with all the running.

The net effect of all this is that every evening I get to play with water and funnels in the sink! (Mom, Dad and Becky can vouch that I've always liked to play with water in the sink.)

I give you, The Water Game:
