Looking back at the marathon, I feel really good about it. I had tried to stick well to this <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/marathon/novices.html">novice training schedule</a> I'd found online, and by the morning of the race, even though the bottom was dropping out of my chest, I knew I'd be able to finish alright.

I cued up "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name">Where the Streets Have No Name</a>" on Karen's iPod at the starting line, waiting to push play until they said go. I hadn't remembered the first line, but as I was turning left out the cooperative college gate onto the main road, Bono came in with "I want to run," and holy cow, I almost lost it.

Running itself was pretty much normal. I was worried about starting off too fast, so I found a few people who looked like they were going at a good pace, and we stuck together through the first half of the race.

After that, Karen's marathon support plan kicked into full gear---she'd stationed people <em>every mile</em> with all sorts of gummy bears, jelly beans, water bottles, potato chips, and sponge buckets. It was fun!

Some of them even ran along with me for a while, which was <em>super</em> encouraging. Jen pushed Benjamin in the stroller, Joe told me corny programmer jokes, and Aaron just kept running---for 11 miles! Here we are coming down the hill with 2&frac12; left.

During those last couple of miles, my quads started cramping and a blister popped on my little toe, but by then it was hard to care about much of anything.

By the time I got to the finish line, I could keep running, but I think that was only because of developed habit, not because I actually had anything left. I don't think I've ever felt so right cursing in desperation before.

Two and a half weeks later, I'm feeling great, and totally eager to keep running. There's supposed to be a <a href="http://www.serengetimarathon.com/run/index.php/serengeti-half-marathon/">half-marathon in the Serengeti</a> in June, and it looks like there are some other folks here who'd also be interested---though it'll be one heckuva road trip to get all the way out there!

Also, thanks so much to all of you who helped <a href="{{ "/2008/02/08/running-for-the-kilimanjaro-porters-assistance-project/" | absolute_url }}">support</a> the Porters Assistance Project. We came in over our goal, and Karen's thrilled!
