So, our trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meru_(Tanzania)">Mount Meru</a> was AWESOME. I've let the time since pass without writing about it, so the stories are less clear in my head, but:

<ul>
<li>Altitude makes a BIG difference.</li>
<li>I loved practicing Swahili with the guides and porters.</li>
<li>I want to climb Kili now. (More later...)</li>
</ul>
