My trouble with blogging is that when I'm doing things I'd write about, I don't have any time to write about them. So:

My buddies <a href="http://gotmikhail.com/">Michael</a> and <a href="http://lotzefamily.com/blog/">Andrew</a> made the trip last month, and we climbed the mountain together!

They're both quite good photographers, so I didn't even bother carrying a camera. The shot above's from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gotmikhail/sets/72157607002387170/">Michael's Tanzania photoset on Flickr</a>, and <a href="http://lotzefamily.com/pictures/2008AUGkili/">Andrew's are up (with hilarious comments) on his site</a>.

On the climb, you really come to appreciate the strength and tirelessness of the guides and porters---and to realize (machismo notwithstanding) that there's no way you could make it up the mountain without all these guys carrying your stuff for you.

We climbed with <a href="http://maranguhotel.com/">Marangu Hotel</a>, who take good care of their porters. Many, many companies don't, so I'd encourage you to check out the <a href="http://kiliporters.org/">Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project</a> and lend a hand as you're able.
