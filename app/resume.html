        <h1>GRITS Inventory Application, A Large Pharmaceutical Company</h1>
        <p>This application tracks inventories of various biological reagents
        in freezers around the world, along with their quality assurance
        histories. We had particular fun writing a Javascript employee-lookup
        widget backed by the company's LDAP directory and somehow managed to
        move through 2 ORMs and 3 web frameworks along the way. Written in
        Java, eventually with WebWork, Hibernate, and PicoContainer.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Assay Annotation Application, A Large Pharmaceutical Company</h1>
        <p>This is a simple note-taking application on the histories of various
        experiments. Written in Java with WebWork, Hibernate, and
        PicoContainer.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Plate Tools Application, A Large Pharmaceutical Company</h1>
        <p>This application calculates serial dilutions of solutions in arrays
        of wells, and then reflects their updated states in various legacy
        databases. Written in Java with OpenSails, a Rails-inspired framework
        that made judicious use of Java's static typing.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>Employee Rewards Application, A Small Startup</h1>
        <p>This simple rewards catalog, customized for each customer, allowed
        their employees to search for and select products by tag. Written in
        Rails, back in the 1.x days.</p>

        <h1>Internal Development Server</h1>
        <p>I donated my old Pentium 133 from college and set it up to host
        bugzilla, a wiki, our maven repository, project javadocs, a yum
        repository mirror, and our subversion repositories. Along the way, I
        also helped the other developers transition to using an early
        release of Fedora on their desktops.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>Arkdom Plus Mobile Device Characteristics</h1>
        <p>This obfuscated Java library provided mobile device
        information&mdash;screen size, color depth&mdash;based on User Agent
        headers. Far too much of our work involved searching out these
        parameters on the internet!</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Arkdom Commerce Platform</h1>
        <p>This web application, customized per client, aggregated affiliate
        marketing links to products around the internet. I wrote tools for
        parallel Lucene search indexing, set up a failover hosting environment,
        and eventually earned permission to migrate the codebase away from
        EJBs.</p>

        <h1>Rental Agreements, A Large Car Rental Company</h1>
        <p>As business waned, I was hired out to an experimental technologies
        group at a large rental car company, flying up to Long Island most
        weeks. I wrote SOAP request handlers that generated rental agreement
        forms and sent them to the printers. My work was one of the first
        projects to emerge from the group, and I received surprisingly
        enthusiastic feedback on my code.</p>
