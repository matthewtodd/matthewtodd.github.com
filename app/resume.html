        <p>Live at <a class="self"
          href="http://masifio.co.tz/">masifio.co.tz</a> since August 2010,
        this application receives about 50 orders each week of produce to be
        shipped from a farm in southern Tanzania to up-market hotels and safari
        lodges. It receives customer and product lists from Quickbooks and
        generates packing lists and invoices in return. As internet access is
        frustratingly slow, I've paid close attention to load times, keeping
        pages light and assets aggressively cached. Written in Rails, hosted on
        Heroku.</p>

        December, this site receives orders for greeting and gift cards,
        tracking inventory for multiple distributors and accepting payments by
        PayPal and JustGiving. Over the past 2 seasons, this app has handled
        hundreds of orders, representing over $20,000 raised for the Amani
        children. <a href="https://github.com/amanikids/cards">Written in

        <p>This application helps Amani's social workers manage their caseloads
        and schedule their visits to children's families in the hopes of
        reunification. From their workflows, it also displays overview
        statistics for management staff. <a

        Ubuntu system hosted samba shares and the children's database up until
        its replacement in late 2010 by Dropbox and Heroku. It also provided a
        number of iptables restrictions in an attempt to reduce Amani's
        satellite internet charges.</p>

        <h1>HeadsUp OS X Application</h1>
        <p><a href="http://matthewtodd.github.com/heads_up">HeadsUp</a> is a
        simple clone of GeekTool I wrote to explore OS X development &mdash;
        and because I found GeekTool's configuration far too distracting. The
        first version was in RubyCocoa; I've since rewritten it in Objective-C.
        I love HeadsUp for keeping my agenda on my desktop, but I can't seem to
        convince anyone else that it's awesome!</p>

        <h1>Deploying a Chef Server on Heroku</h1>
        <p>I dug into Chef's server code just enough to learn how to <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/skillet">Rack it up
          directly</a>. Along the way, I also wrote a minimal <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/hideabed">CouchDB clone in
          Rails</a> with a simple <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/doily">JavaScript
          interpreter</a>. Unfortunately, Chef clients are pretty HTTP-chatty,
        so using a remote Chef server doesn't yet make much sense in
        Tanzania.</p>

        <h1>GRITS Inventory Application, A Large Pharmaceutical Company</h1>
        <p>This application tracks inventories of various biological reagents
        in freezers around the world, along with their quality assurance
        histories. We had particular fun writing a Javascript employee-lookup
        widget backed by the company's LDAP directory and somehow managed to
        move through 2 ORMs and 3 web frameworks along the way. Written in
        Java, eventually with WebWork, Hibernate, and PicoContainer.</p>

        <p>This application calculates serial dilutions of solutions in arrays

        databases. Written in Java with OpenSails, a Rails-inspired framework
        that made judicious use of Java's static typing.</p>

        <h1>Internal Development Server</h1>
        <p>I donated my old Pentium 133 from college and set it up to host
        bugzilla, a wiki, our maven repository, project javadocs, a yum
        repository mirror, and our subversion repositories. Along the way, I
        also helped the other developers transition to using an early

        <h1>Arkdom Plus Mobile Device Characteristics</h1>
        <p>This obfuscated Java library provided mobile device
        information&mdash;screen size, color depth&mdash;based on User Agent
        headers. Far too much of our work involved searching out these
        parameters on the internet!</p>

      <section>
        <h1>Arkdom Commerce Platform</h1>
        <p>This web application, customized per client, aggregated affiliate
        marketing links to products around the internet. I wrote tools for
        parallel Lucene search indexing, set up a failover hosting environment,
        and eventually earned permission to migrate the codebase away from
        EJBs.</p>

        <p>As business waned, I was hired out to an experimental technologies
        group at a large rental car company, flying up to Long Island most
        weeks. I wrote SOAP request handlers that generated rental agreement
        forms and sent them to the printers. My work was one of the first
        projects to emerge from the group, and I received surprisingly
        enthusiastic feedback on my code.</p>
