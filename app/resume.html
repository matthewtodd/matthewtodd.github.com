        <h1>Masifio Estates &mdash; Vegetable Ordering Application</h1>
        <p>Live at <a class="self"
          href="http://masifio.co.tz/">masifio.co.tz</a> since August 2010,
        this application receives about 50 orders each week of produce to be
        shipped from a farm in southern Tanzania to up-market hotels and safari
        lodges. It receives customer and product lists from Quickbooks and
        generates packing lists and invoices in return. As internet access is
        frustratingly slow, I've paid close attention to load times, keeping
        pages light and assets aggressively cached. Written in Rails, hosted on
        Heroku.</p>

          access</a>. I replaced their aging server with a <a
          href="https://github.com/hcts/chef-repo">Chef-configured</a> Ubuntu
        system, providing a <a
          href="https://github.com/hcts/hectic">web interface</a> for adding
        and removing customers.

        December, this site receives orders for greeting and gift cards,
        tracking inventory for multiple distributors and accepting payments by
        PayPal and JustGiving. Over the past 2 seasons, this app has handled

        <h1>Amani Children's Home &mdash; Children's Database</h1>
        <p>This application helps Amani's social workers manage their caseloads
        and schedule their visits to children's families in the hopes of
        reunification. From their workflows, it also displays overview
        statistics for management staff. <a

        Ubuntu system hosted samba shares and the children's database up until
        its replacement in late 2010 by Dropbox and Heroku. It also provided a
        number of iptables restrictions in an attempt to reduce Amani's
        satellite internet charges.</p>

        <h1>OSX Application &mdash; HeadsUp</h1>
        <p><a href="http://matthewtodd.github.com/heads_up">HeadsUp</a> is a
        simple clone of GeekTool I wrote to explore OS X development &mdash;
        and because I found GeekTool's configuration far too distracting. The
        first few versions were in RubyCocoa; I've since rewritten it in
        Objective-C. I love HeadsUp for keeping my agenda on my desktop, but I
        can't seem to convince anyone else that it's awesome!</p>

        displays all the words that can be spelled with a given set of letters.
        It uses a C extension to avoid creating thousands of throwaway strings
        as it loops through the dictionary. Try it out at <a class="self"

        <h1>Deploying a Chef Server on Heroku</h1>
        <p>I dug into Chef's server code just enough to learn how to <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/skillet">Rack it up
          directly</a>. Along the way, I also wrote a minimal <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/hideabed">CouchDB clone in
          Rails</a> with a simple <a
          href="https://github.com/matthewtodd/doily">JavaScript
          interpreter</a>. Unfortunately, Chef clients are pretty HTTP-chatty,
        so using a remote Chef server doesn't yet make much sense in
        Tanzania.</p>
