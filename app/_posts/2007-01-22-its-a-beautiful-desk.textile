Back in December, we talked with Valerie's carpenter friend, Fundi Kawau, and asked him to build me a desk. He did the work for $50, finished in about a week and then carted the whole thing up to our house in a wheelbarrow.

He's done beautiful work, and his craftsmanship amazes me -- all the corners and edges are rounded, the finish is smooth, and there's no joining hardware in sight.

The raised platform keeps me from hunching over the laptop screen, which is just what my neck and back needed. Someday I may try to get a bigger and brighter monitor, but for now this setup's working quite well.

I feel very grateful to live here.
